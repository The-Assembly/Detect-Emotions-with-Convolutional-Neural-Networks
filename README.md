# Detect-Emotions-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a special category of deep neural networks particularly suited to the analysis of visual imagery – and commonly applied in facial recognition, image classification, and medical imaging.  In this session, we’ll demonstrate how to use CNNs to detect a person’s mood and emotions based on their facial expressions. We’ll use TensorFlow in Colab to build, train, and test our model &amp; show you how to refine the process for best results.  Prerequisites: —Basic knowledge of Python and machine learning concepts —Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/)
